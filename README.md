# fingerprint-attendance-device

This project involves a computer vision task in a Jupyter Notebook. This project implements a Few-Shot Learning algorithm for a Fingureprint Attendance device on the SOCOFing dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing).

## üìÅ Project Structure:

1. The SOCOFing dataset is loaded.

2. The user is assumed to enter 5 fingerprints for the device to identify them.
3. The 5 different attempts are 3 rotations with a random angle, a Gaussian noise, and a cropped center
4. These 5 functions are applied on the dataset for every fingerprint, and 350 IDs are created.

5. The positive and negative pairs are created.
6. The Siamese network with a ResNet50 as a feature extractor is created.
7. he network is trained with the trained data, and then retrained with the support set.
8. Then the network is tested with the query set.

### How does the algorithm work?
In this algorithm the new user is identified with 5 fingerprints. This is done through augmention of three rotations with random angle, noisy and crop center functions for each user.
Then, the Siamese network is trained with this dataset and retrained with the support set with the IDs from 591 to 600.
The query set consists of a random rotation of 1 fingerprint of IDs 591 to 600, and the network identifies this user.
